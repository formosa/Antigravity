### 11.1 Quick Classification Guide

| Information Type | Primary Tier | Secondary Tier (if hybrid) |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Business goal | BRD | - |
| Market problem | BRD | - |
| SLA target | BRD | NFR (if quantified) |
| Hardware spec | NFR | - |
| Performance target | NFR | - |
| Security constraint | NFR | BRD (if strategic) |
| User workflow | FSD | - |
| Feature capability | FSD | - |
| Error handling behavior | FSD | - |
| Architectural pattern | SAD | - |
| Component topology | SAD | - |
| Technology choice | SAD | NFR (if constraint-driven) |
| JSON schema | ICD | - |
| Config format | ICD | - |
| API contract | ICD | - |
| Class structure | TDD | - |
| Method signature | TDD | ISP (if stub included) |
| Dependency list | TDD | - |
| Code stub | ISP | - |
| Docstring | ISP | - |

### 11.2 Traceability Validation Checklist

-   [ ] Every tag has format `TIER-N` or `TIER-N.M`
-   [ ] Every child cites parent(s) using `:links: PARENT`
-   [ ] No forward references (child cited before parent defined)
-   [ ] No sibling citations (FSD-X.1 :links: FSD-X.2)
-   [ ] No circular chains (A :links: B :links: A)
-   [ ] Reconciliation manifest matches actual tag count
-   [ ] No orphaned tags (except BRD root level)
-   [ ] All ISP stubs reference TDD components
-   [ ] All TDD components cite ICD schemas (where applicable)
-   [ ] All SAD patterns trace to NFR constraints or FSD features

### 11.3 Persona-Question-Output Map


| Tier | Persona | Core Question | Typical Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| BRD | Executive | "Why invest?" | ROI justification, strategic objectives |
| NFR | SysAdmin | "What limits?" | Performance SLAs, hardware specs |
| Product Manager | "What features?" | Use cases, workflows, acceptance criteria |
| SAD | Architect | "What structure?" | Topology diagrams, pattern selections |
| ICD | Data Engineer | "What contracts?" | JSON schemas, YAML configs, API specs |
| TDD | Lead Developer | "What classes?" | Component blueprints, method signatures |
| ISP | Code Generator | "What scaffold?" | Python stubs with docstrings |
